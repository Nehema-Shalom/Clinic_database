#  ðŸŽ€Clinic Booking System 

This project allows managing patients, doctors, appointments, departments, payments, and medical records in a clean and organized way. It provides a centralized system where clinic staff can easily keep track of patient information, schedule appointments, manage doctors and their departments, and ensure that all payments and medical records are properly recorded. With this system, administrative tasks become faster, more accurate, and less stressful, while giving staff a clear overview of the clinicâ€™s operations. Itâ€™s designed to be intuitive, efficient, and scalable, making it perfect for clinics of any size that want to stay organized and provide better care to their patients.
